# foundry-elemental-self
A Foundry VTT module for D&amp;D 5e that adds the Elemental Self system to character sheets. Elements are narrative-driven metaphysical forces that awaken through story moments and grant Element Dice to empower actions, enabling anime-tier, roleplay-first character progression.
