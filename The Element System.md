**✨ Your Elemental Self: A Guide to the Element System ✨**

A Narrative Power System for D\&D and Beyond

---

## **🌟 What Are Elements?**

Elements are metaphysical forces that define your character’s essence. Far beyond simple elements like fire or water, they embody abstract, emotional, philosophical, or personal truths.

* **Your Starting Point:** Every character begins with three dormant Elements, forming a triangle that shapes their inner self.  
* **Awakening Moments:** Elements come to life through pivotal story events—great victories, emotional revelations, divine encounters, or life-altering trauma.  
* **Why They Matter:** Elements aren’t just power; they’re resonance, reflecting who your character is at their core.

**Example Elements:**

* **Gravity**: Force, weight, anchoring, impact  
* **Dreams**: Aspiration, instinct, surreal insight  
* **Discipline**: Self-control, training, focus  
* **Humanity**: Emotion, empathy, connection  
* **Swords**: The way of the blade; technique and philosophy  
* **Electro**: Pure lightning, energy flow, spiritual spark

---

## **✨ Choosing Your Elements**

At character creation, you have flexibility in selecting your Elements:

* **Choose Freely**: Pick three dormant Elements that resonate with your character’s essence.  
* **DM Guidance**: Your DM may suggest Elements based on your backstory, race, or campaign.  
* **Leave It Open**: Opt to leave one or more Elements blank, discovering them through gameplay.

Your Element triangle should reflect how your character interacts with the world—not just their powers, but their values, instincts, and inner world.

Example Character: *Reiya, Mink Storm Dragon Samurai*

* **Electro**: Core to both subraces (lightning and electricity)  
* **Swords**: A lifelong discipline  
* **Humanity**: His unbreakable will (or perhaps Divinity if his celestial heritage awakens)

Sample Element Prompts:

* **Fire**: Passion, rage, destruction  
* **Survival**: Tenacity, instincts, will to live  
* **Philosophy**: Thought, perspective, the search for truth  
* **Freedom**: Rebellion, independence, unbound spirit  
* **Logic**: Precision, clarity, unemotional resolve  
* **Beast**: Primal nature, dominance, animal instinct

## **🎮 Using Element Dice**

Once awakened, each Element grants **1d6 per turn** to enhance *any roll* you make. These dice represent your character’s inner power surging to life. Here’s how it works:

* **Where and When to Apply**: You may add **1d6** from an awakened Element to *any roll* made during your turn—attacks, skill checks, saving throws, or more.  
* **Multiple Dice per Turn**: With multiple awakened Elements, you can distribute your dice freely across your turn. Stack them on a single roll for a dramatic boost or spread them across different actions for versatility.  
* **Narrative Flair**: While not required, describing how your Element shapes your action adds depth and immersion to the moment.

**Examples**:

* **Gravity**: Add 1d6 to a melee attack for a seismic slam that shakes the ground.  
* **Dreams**: Use 1d6 to enhance a Stealth check, guided by surreal intuition.  
* **Humanity**: Empower a Persuasion roll with 1d6+1, channeling heartfelt connection.

### **Reaction & Legendary Action Rules**

* **Reactions**: Element Dice cannot be used for reactions, such as opportunity attacks.  
* **Ready Actions**: These *do* qualify, as you’ve sacrificed your turn to prepare.  
* **Legendary Actions**: These only benefit from Element Dice if they occur during the creature’s turn.  
* **Contested Rolls and Saving Throws**: If an opponent uses an Element Die against you (e.g., boosting a spell’s damage, a grappling check, or a contested skill), you may freely use your Element Dice to defend. This includes:  
  * **Saving Throws**: Add 1d6 to a saving throw against a spell or effect where the opponent applied an Element Die to enhance damage or difficulty.  
  * **Contested Checks**: Use 1d6 to resist an opponent’s Element-enhanced grapple, shove, or similar action.

## **⭐ Leveling Up Your Elements**

Each Element starts at 1d6, but you can gain flat bonuses (e.g., 1d6+1, 1d6+2) through roleplay and narrative growth. Growth comes from:

* **Major Character Arcs**: Emotional milestones or personal breakthroughs.  
* **Divine or Relic Influence**: Encounters with gods or powerful artifacts.  
* **Thematic Use**: Repeatedly embodying the Element in meaningful ways.  
* **Trials and Fears**: Facing challenges tied to your Element’s essence.

**No Hard Cap**: Your Element Dice can grow indefinitely, but the stronger you become, the more the world will respond with dramatic consequences.

---

## **🎭 Examples in Action**

**Scene 1: The Samurai’s Leap**

*“I leap from the tower, blade drawn. Gravity fuels my descent—the blow lands with seismic weight (+1d6+2). As I fall, Dreams guide my aim to strike true (+1d6 to hit). I land, roar, and command the enemy to stand down, Humanity burning in my voice (+1d6+1 Intimidation).”*

**Scene 2: The Silent Reflection**

*“She stands in silence before the mirror. Her Discipline won’t let her cry. But Humanity trembles behind her eyes (+1d6 Insight). As she steps away, her Logic kicks in—there’s a pattern in the events around the murders (+1d6 Investigation).”*

---

## **🕵️ DM’s Notes**

As the DM, you shape how Elements come to life in your campaign:

* **Awakenings**: Make them dramatic and personal, tied to character arcs, bonds, or major events.  
* **Corruption & Sealing**: Elements can be twisted, stolen, or locked by gods, enemies, or trauma.  
* **Hidden Elements**: Some characters may uncover a rare 4th Element through legendary events.  
* **Balance & Story**: Enemies should have Elements too, resonating, clashing, or mirroring the party’s. Villains might even weaponize a player’s Elements against them.  
* **Temporary Elements**: Gear, relics, or spirits can grant short-term bonus Elements.  
* **Conflict**: When Elements clash (e.g., Mercy vs. Wrath), create moments of tension and risk.  
* I highly suggest that with this module you think of creating high level armour items that give bonuses to AC as with suhc high roles AC might become a stagnant resource.

---

## **🌟 Final Word**

The Element System is about character essence, not just mechanics. It’s designed to let players shine, express, and narrate their journey.

* Make every bonus roll personal.  
* Make every Element feel alive.  
* Build legends.

Designed for anime-tier storytelling. Powered by roleplay. Fueled by dreams.

## **📖 Element System – Q\&A and Clarifications**

 

---

 

### **Q: How are Elements chosen at character creation?**

**🟢 A: Players begin with 3 dormant Elements that reflect their character's nature. The DM may recommend fitting Elements based on their backstory or theme. For example, a Mink Storm Dragon who mastered swordsmanship may be guided toward Electro, Swords, and Humanity.**

**Players can choose all three, leave some blank for narrative awakening, or ask the DM to help shape their triangle. The goal is storytelling first, mechanics second.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can two characters have the same Element triangle?**

**🟢 A: Yes\! Element combinations don’t need to be unique. Many NPCs or villagers might share a simple set like Humanity, Gravity, and Dreams. It’s about expression, not exclusivity.**

 

---

 

### **Q: What if someone chooses “Attack,” “Combat,” and “Power” to min-max?**

**🟢 A: That’s allowed—if the character is truly defined by those traits, the DM embraces it. This system supports power fantasy storytelling, and the DM will design challenges that match. Every Element triangle tells a story, even if it’s one of raw dominance and strength.**

 

---

 

### **Q: How many Element Dice can you use per turn?**

**🟢 A: As many as you have awakened.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Do you declare Element Dice before or after a roll?**

**🟢 A: After the roll. Players often forget to declare bonuses before rolling, so to make things smoother and more fun, the die can be spent post-roll to enhance the result, as long as it's still thematically justified. But DMs please be careful when you give a spell that requires a DC check to save against, if you apply elemental Die to a damage you need to roll the damage before the players attemps the DC so it's fair and they can see if they can apply elemental dice or not.** 

---

 

### **Q: Is there any resource management or cooldown for Element Dice?**

**🟢 A: No cooldown. Once an Element is awakened, its die is usable every turn. This is a powerful system by design—players are encouraged to feel legendary, creative, and cinematic with it.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Is there a maximum for how strong an Element can become?**

**🟢 A: There is no hard cap. You start at 1d6, and flat bonuses can be added through growth (1d6+1, 1d6+2, etc.). As long as the story supports it, you can scale as high as needed—but enemies will, too.**

 

---

 

### **Q: How fast do Elements level up or grow in power?**

**🟢 A: It’s based on story progression. In one-shots, the DM might hand out growth freely. In long campaigns, growth typically comes after arcs, emotional moments, or narrative turning points.**

 

---

 

### **Q: What if one player uses their Elements all the time, but another forgets?**

**🟢 A: This system rewards players who engage with it, but it's meant to be easy and inviting. The DM can remind players gently or refer them to the Foundry UI tab or the PDF handout. Over time, everyone catches on—and gets their moment to shine. While gentle DM reminders and the Foundry UI tab are great solutions, you could consider a lightweight mechanical nudge to encourage consistent use. For example:**

* **A small narrative “spark” (e.g., a minor story hint or flavor text) when a player uses an Element for the first time in a session.**

* **A temporary “resonance” bonus (e.g., \+1 to a roll) if a player uses all three Elements in a single turn, incentivizing experimentation.**  
  **These could be optional rules to keep the system simple while encouraging players to lean into their Elements.**

 

---

 

### **Q: What if a player’s Element use feels like a stretch or doesn’t make sense?**

**🟢 A: The system is flexible. Narrative justification is encouraged but not strictly required. If a player wants to add 1d6 from “Discipline” to a dodge roll and it kind of fits? Let it happen. Combat goblins who just want cool bonuses are welcome too.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can the DM veto an Element or how it’s used?**

**🟢 A: Yes. The DM always has final say—especially if an Element concept is inappropriate or completely disconnected from the story. But if someone’s playing a dog? Dog Food might actually be a valid Element. It’s about context and collaboration.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Are there tools to help players describe their Element use better?**

**🟢 A: A full UI module is in progress for Foundry, featuring tooltip info, a tracker, and example use cases. For now, the PDF and in-game guides will give players enough to get inspired. No pressure to roleplay deeply—but it's there if they want it.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can Elements be used outside of combat?**

**🟢 A: Yes\! Any roll—combat or narrative—can benefit from Element Dice as long as it’s during the player’s turn or in an open narrative moment. This includes Persuasion checks, puzzle solving, and even performance scenes.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can you use multiple Element Dice in one roll?**

**🟢 A: Yes. You can combo multiple Elements into a single roll. Example: Use Gravity, Dreams, and Humanity together to boost a single damage roll or Intimidation check. You’re building your soul into the action.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Do NPCs and villains use Elements too?**

**🟢 A: Absolutely. Major NPCs and enemies have their own Elements, and they will use them strategically. In some cases, they might even mirror or steal a player’s Element mid-battle.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can Elements be lost, sealed, or corrupted?**

**🟢 A: Yes. Just like they can awaken through growth, Elements can be sealed by gods, warped by trauma, or stolen by artifacts. A corrupted Element might even fight back until it’s purified or bonded with.**

 

---

 

### **Q: What happens if a character dies and is revived?**

**🟢 A: That’s up to the DM and story. Usually, the character retains their awakened Elements. But a god might alter or replace one of them as part of the revival process. Flexible, story-first.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can you change your Element?**

**🟢 A: Yes—but only through significant story moments. A warrior turning into a cyborg might trade Humanity for Machine. It’s rare, but powerful. The player and DM should discuss it when the character evolves.**

 

---

 

### **Q: What if someone constantly uses vague “narrative justification” to get bonuses?**

**🟢 A: That’s okay—especially if it fits their character. If someone’s Element is Dreams and they truly live by that theme, let them roll. If it starts to feel repetitive or gamey, talk after the session. Most cases just add flavor and fuel the story anyway.**

---

 

### **Q: Can Legendary Actions or Multiattacks use Element Dice?**

**🟢 A: Multiattacks can benefit from Element Dice—but only once per turn, even if the creature makes multiple attacks. Choose wisely which part of the multiattack gets the extra power.**

**❌ Legendary Actions do not benefit from Element Dice. This preserves their balance and reinforces that Element Dice are about personal energy in a creature’s actual turn.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Does this stack with other effects like Bardic Inspiration, Bless, or Guidance?**

**🟢 A: Yes, Element Dice stack freely with any other bonuses like Bardic Inspiration, spell boosts, class features, or magic items. The idea is to amplify storytelling and power, not limit it.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Are you worried about power creep from always having \+2d6 or more per turn?**

**🟢 A: Not at all. This system is built for high-powered anime vibes, where characters become mythic and can blow up mountains. Power creep is the goal—and enemies will scale to match with their own Elements.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can Elements evolve over time?**

**🟢 A: YES. As a character grows, their Element may shift to reflect who they’ve become. For example, Vengeance could evolve into Justice… or into Wrath. Evolution is a big story moment and should be discussed with the DM.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can a character have a secret or hidden Element that awakens later?**

**🟢 A: Yes—and it’s awesome. Hidden Elements can be unlocked through major narrative arcs, divine interference, or intense personal transformation. They might even be unknown to the player until the right moment.**

**This works best as a reward for legendary growth—something earned, not handed out casually.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can Elements clash with each other in combos?**

**🟢 A: Yes, absolutely. Philosophical or emotional conflicts between Elements—like Mercy vs Wrath—can create moments of tension or internal conflict. This is a storytelling opportunity, not a mechanical penalty (unless the DM wants it to be\!).**

**Optional lore idea: In some worlds, conflicting Elements might cause a “soul strain” or leak if used recklessly.**

**The idea of philosophical conflicts between Elements (e.g., Mercy vs. Wrath) is a fantastic storytelling hook, but it’s currently left as a narrative opportunity without mechanical weight. This is fine for simplicity, but you could add an optional rule to make these moments more tangible. For example:**

* **When two conflicting Elements are used in the same turn, the player might roll a d20 to determine if there’s “soul strain” (e.g., on a 1-5, one Element Die is suppressed for the turn).**

* **Alternatively, a DM could impose a narrative consequence (e.g., a vision or emotional turmoil) that sets up a future arc to resolve the conflict.**  
  **This could add depth without overcomplicating the system.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can Elements manifest visually or magically during use?**

**🟢 A: Definitely. Visual manifestation is encouraged\! Examples:**

* **Humanity might shimmer as golden aura (Haki style)**

* **Electro might crackle with lightning**

* **Dreams might look like ghostly afterimages**

**This is all optional flair, but players are encouraged to describe their Element’s energy, aura, or effect to make it feel vivid and unique.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can a player choose not to use one of their Elements?**

**🟢 A: Yes\! If it makes sense for their character, a player can refuse to call on a specific Element. This could be a roleplay moment (“I’ll never use Humanity again after what happened...”) or a temporary story beat.**

---

### **Q: Can Elements be fused into custom combinations?**

**🟡 A: Only in very rare, story-breaking situations. Fusion is not just mixing bonuses—it’s becoming a new person, forging a new way to exist.**

* **If the fusion is between two internal Elements, it must be a full transformation (e.g., Discipline \+ Fire becomes Forge).**

* **It’s not meant to create 2d6 super boosts. Instead, it replaces or reshapes your triangle.**

**High risk, high reward. Could even damage your soul if rushed.**

**Tip: Fusion is possible when outside powers (artifacts, gods, ancient creatures) are involved.**

 

---

### **Q: Can enemies steal or mirror player Elements?**

**🟢 A: YES. This is narratively and mechanically supported. Enemies may:**

* **Copy your Element**

* **Seal your Element temporarily**

* **Twist or corrupt it to turn against you**

**Use this for major boss fights or emotional showdowns.**

---

 

### **Q: Can characters gain temporary Elements?**

**🟢 A: Yes\! This can happen through:**

* **Magical devices**

* **Divine blessings**

* **Cursed artifacts**

* **Environmental exposure (e.g., walking into a void storm)**

**Temporary Elements grant 1d6 just like normal ones but are usually limited in time or number of uses.**

---

### **Q: Is there a limit to how many Elements a character can have?**

**🟢 A: No hard limit, but the default triangle is 3\. Players can eventually gain 4th or even 5th Elements through extreme story progression, such as:**

* **Becoming a demigod**  
* **Hosting ancient spirits**  
* **Forging multiple souls together**

**The Foundry UI currently supports up to 12 Elements visually. Beyond that, you’re in mythic-tier territory—rare, but not impossible.**

### **Q: How does the system handle Contested Rolls or opposed checks?**

**🟢 A: In social or narrative contests (like Deception vs Insight), both parties may use Element Dice, if they have one that fits the action. And if you are challenged with an elemental roll you can also use your elements to fight back to keep it fair.**

**Example: A barbarian uses Gravity to grapple. The enemy rogue, with Freedom, might resist with 1d6 if the DM agrees it fits.**  
**Rule of thumb: If the contest is meaningful and both have a reason to resist using their soul? Let them.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can Element Dice be used for saving throws against status effects like fear or stun?**

**🟢 A: Yes, in your turn. And outside your turn only if the initiator is also using an elemental dice to atack you harder or damage you harder. It's fair game that you aslo use your elmets to defend yourself against such devastation. BUT if the initiator doesn't use elments to atack you you yourself cannot use elements.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can passive skills like Passive Insight or Passive Perception benefit from Elements?**

**🟡 A: No. Passive scores don't involve rolling dice, and this system only activates on active rolls. If a trap is hidden, your Dreams won't save you passively—only if you’re actively searching or reacting.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can you store or delay the use of an Element Die?**

**🔴 A: Not currently. Element Dice must be used on the turn you have them, and they don’t carry over. There are no “charging” or “banking” mechanics yet—for simplicity.**

**BUT: This could be an awesome future mechanic for high-level feats or relics (e.g., “Store Gravity this turn to unleash 2d6 next”).**

 

---

 

### **Q: What happens if two of a player’s Elements are in philosophical conflict?**

**🟢 A: That’s an amazing roleplay opportunity\! While mechanically they work fine, the character might suffer internal tension—a great moment for drama.**

**Example: A player with Mercy and Wrath might find that using both in one scene feels wrong—or narratively dangerous.**

**There’s no penalty by default, but DMs are encouraged to highlight these moments as key story beats.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can a character’s Elements evolve based on how others see them?**

**🟡 A: Yes, but it’s rare and usually tied to hidden or corrupted Elements. A character who believes they embody Justice might secretly awaken Tyranny due to how the world perceives them—or a god might twist their nature.**

**This is best used in epic arcs, and often as a surprise twist or moment of reckoning.**

 

---

 

### **Q: What happens if a player loses all three Elements?**

**🔴 A: This is soul-death. A character with no Elements is barely alive, or worse—possessed, cursed, or spiritually blank.**

**This could mean:**

* **They’re fully corrupted**

* **They’ve become a hollow shell**

* **They’re temporarily unplayable unless healed or reawakened**

**It’s a high-stakes punishment or consequence—and a launchpad for a redemption arc.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can players with the same Element create combos or resonance effects?**

**🟢 A: YES. Shared Elements can resonate—creating powerful combo moments between characters.**

**Example: Two players with Hope stand side-by-side in battle. If they both act using Hope in the same turn, the DM might allow an extra effect (light burst, AoE buff, or cinematic combo move).**

**You can even have moments where one player empowers another’s Element, like a ritual or soul-bond. These are rare, but incredible storytelling moments.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Do enemies have weaknesses or resistances to certain Elements?**

**🟢 A: Absolutely. DMs are encouraged to create Elemental vulnerabilities or immunities tied to the enemy’s theme.**

* **A demon might take extra damage from Humanity but resist Wrath.**

* **A machine god might be weak to Emotion-based Elements but immune to Logic.**

**These weaknesses can be mechanical (+1d6 bonus turns into \+2d6) or flavor-driven (only certain Elements can damage this creature). Make them personal.**

**Example: A villain who embodies Joy might be devastated when hit with Sorrow or Truth. That’s emotional resonance made real.**

### **Q: What happens when a player has multiple narrative reasons to use the same Element in one turn?**

**🟢 A: That’s 100% allowed. If every action you take in a turn is thematically tied to your Humanity or Wrath, go for it. There’s no limit to how many times a single Element can be used per turn, as long as you have multiple actions.**

**The only time you might lose access to an Element mid-turn is due to a special story event or enemy effect (like corruption or sealing).**

---

### **Q: Can you use Element Dice with spellcasting?**

**🟢 A: Yes. Element Dice can enhance:**

* **Spell attack rolls (e.g., Eldritch Blast, Guiding Bolt)**

* **Spell damage rolls (e.g., Fireball, Smite)**

* **Any rolled effect from a spell**

**❌ Not for DCs: You cannot use Element Dice to raise the spell save DC, because it’s not a roll.**

**Area-of-effect (AoE) spells like Thunderwave still count—if it’s a damage roll, you can boost it. Simple and clean.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can enemies lock, twist, or force the use of Elements against the player?**

**🟢 A: Yes. Enemies may:**

* **Seal or lock away one of your Elements temporarily**

* **Reverse it—turning Gravity into weightlessness, Dreams into nightmares**

* **Force you to make a roll using a corrupted version of your own soul**

**These are powerful story beats and should be used rarely but impactfully. Think: soul curses, rival gods, or trauma-induced transformation.**

**Pro tip: DMs can literally “rip out” an Element from a character and make them win it back.**

---

### **Q: Do Elements affect death saves or unconsciousness?**

**🔴 A: No. To keep death meaningful and fair, Element Dice do not apply to death saving throws.**

---

### **Q: Can a character willingly abandon an Element?**

**🟢 A: Yes. Whether through trauma, emotional change, or a roleplay decision, a player may choose to discard or suppress an Element.**

**This might trigger:**

* **An Empty Slot state (you must awaken a new Element quickly or suffer)**  
* **Or a complete shift in identity (Beast becoming Faith, for example)**

**The DM and player should talk through it—but whether it's a gradual arc or a fast, emotional change, the story rules.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Does multiclassing affect Elements?**

**🟢 A: Not by default. Elements represent your soul, not your class.**  
**But a major class shift—like a rogue becoming a paladin—might lead to an Element evolving naturally (e.g., Desperation becomes Faith).**

**This is optional and purely narrative.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Are there consequences for overusing a single Element?**

**🟢 A: Not mechanically. If a player loves Dreams and uses it all the time, that’s fine\! But the DM may choose to reflect that dominance in the story:**

* **That Element becomes your signature**  
* **Others may weaken or lie dormant**  
* **Enemies or gods may take notice…**

**Story beats, not rules, will shape the consequences.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Do characters with shared Elements gain resonance or combo abilities?**

**🟢 Yes. Think of it as if you have fire and fire together you create a biger flame. If two characters has the same element and they want to use it together I highly encourage DM to give special bonuses to roll.**

 

---

 

### **Q: Can an NPC, god, or villain represent an Elemental Domain?**

**🟢 A: YES. These figures may:**

* **Embody a single Element (like Wrath or Harmony)**

* **Grant or steal Elements from players**

* **Serve as spiritual trialmasters tied to specific Element arcs**

**Example: To awaken Divinity, you must defeat the Champion of Faith in a duel beneath starlight.**

---

### **Q: Would you allow “Negative” Elements like Corruption, Void, or Despair?**

**🟢 A: Yes—with warnings. These anti-Elements could:**

* **Roll a negative die (e.g., \-1d6)**

* **Cause side effects or backlash**

* **Influence your soul, allies, or fate**

**Let players use these if they want to walk a darker path—but be ready to show them what that cost really means.**

---

 **✅ Want to take this even further?**

**I can now:**

* **Add a DM’s Advanced Toolbox to the PDF for Element sealing, fusion rules, and soul-twisting effects**

* **Build enemy stat templates that use Elements (e.g., “Tyranny: 1d6+2 against Hope users”)**

* **Write a mini Element Trial System for characters awakening or evolving their traits**
